# Data Sets

The data set needed to simply do the exercise of the tutorial are preprocessed and ready to download within the
[exercise notebook](https://github.com/ramonpeter/ML4HEP-Tutorial/blob/main/exercise/top_tagging.ipynb).

This folder is **only** required if the user wants to download the raw data and change the preprocessing himself.

DO NOT CHANGE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO!
